This is an application built for you who want's to challange your self with a game against the computer, it is very simple to use. Choose your settings for the map, place your ships and start guessing. You can choose between 3 different difficulties where the hardest can take you a while to finish, click the LINK to try it out.

## Features:

    - Map-size - The size of the map increases in symbiose with the difficulty
    - Ammount of ships - As well as the map, the amount of ships able to place increases.

- Show guesses - All the right and wrong guesses are saved in list and are displayed in order to eas any confusion if the coordinates allready been guessed.

## Features left to implement
---
- Ships taking up more space - One feature I would like to implement is longer ships instead of them being 1:1 coordinates. This would make it more alike the real board game.
