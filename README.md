# Battle Ships

This is an application built for you who want's to challange your self with a game against the computer, it is very simple to use. Choose your settings for the map, place your ships and start guessing. You can choose between 3 different difficulties where the hardest can take you a while to finish, click the LINK to try it out.

## Features:
---
- Difficulties - The user can choose between Easy, Medium and Hard.
    - Map-size - The size of the map increases in symbiose with the difficulty
    - Ammount of ships - As well as the map, the amount of ships able to place increases.
- Place ship modes - User can choose to place out ships either randomly or manually

- Show stats - Throughout the game, updated statistics of the game is printed.

- Show guesses - All the right and wrong guesses are saved in list and are displayed in order to eas any confusion if the coordinates allready been guessed.

## Features left to implement
---
- Ships taking up more space - One feature I would like to implement is longer ships instead of them being 1:1 coordinates. This would make it more alike the real board game.


## Testing
---
- Validation - I have validated the code to make sure that no typos, errors, white spaces or blanc lines interfere with the game meanwhile I tested out the code so that the changes in the code did not affect the experience negative while playing.

- Playing - I have played the game numerous times in order to come up with possible errors occuring while puting in the wrong input as a player, this have helped handling those errors in the code to answer the user once wrong input is provided.

- Other testing - I tried to create the game in different ways, with ships able to be longer than one coordinate making it possible for the user to choose direction and so on. From that have I worked my way to a less complicated version of the game since it both provides a more user friendly experience with a smaller ammount of possible errors and with some tips from my Mentor, it is less time consuming wich was important due to intense time window for the submission. With this said I have tested to create the game in different ways to come up with the best strategy both when it comes to the process of creating and experience while playing.


## Unfixed bugs:
- In general, through out the game you wont experience any bugs except how the information provided by the game is displayed wich is not affecting how the game works.


## Deployment
- First, navigate to heroku dashboard.
- Then create new app
- Once I created the app, navigate to settings in the nav bar.
- I did not need to add any more settings then buildpacks Python and Node.js
    - If you have sensetive information, you need to add config Vars.
- Then I chose deployment method (GitHub)
- After I searched for the repository containing the project and clicked connect
